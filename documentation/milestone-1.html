<h1>
    MILESTONE 1 for Flowergirl and Birdie LLC
</h1>
<h2>
  Purpose
</h2>
<p>
    Project will be a professional portfolio site with a focus to explore the ways in which art made by artificial intelligence can affect people culturally, emotionally, all while inspiring creativity and innovative thinking across various cultures.
</p>
<h2>
    Audience
</h2>
<p>
    Portfolio’s focus is toward the Ai art galleries and individuals who are new to the Ai art trends. Target audience to include: Gallery owners; individuals new to Ai art; and art collectors.
</p>
<h2>
    Goal
</h2>
<p>
    The primary goal of this site is for galleries to initiate contact with me in regard to showcasing my art in their art gallery collections through LinkedIn. The secondary goal of this site is to preserve the feeling of traditional cultural art, so I offer my artworks as premium, one-of-a-kind art pieces, presented on museum-quality framed canvas. To compliment the unique connection between the art and its collector, I pair each piece with an official certificate of authenticity stating the name of the owner, as well as an HD digital file of the artwork.
</p>
<h2>
    Persona
</h2>
<p>
    Sue Hope Age:31
</p>
<h3>
    Profession: Art Curator
</h3>
<p>
    Sue is the Art Curator at Art AI, the world’s largest gallery of AI generated art. She also boasts an impressive record as an art teacher. When she’s not carefully analyzing and selecting art for Art AI’s works, Sue creates her own incredible art; her works have been featured in multiple galleries across London
</p>
<h3>
 Technology
</h3>
<p>
    Sue consistently studies UI, UX and web design and why tasked with ART AI's gallery pieces and a new Ai Art magazine start up in Paris.
</p>
<h3>
    Attitudes and Behaviors
</h3>
<p>
    Overwhelmed with so much Ai art on web. Work and home balance top priority due to new addition to her family and has a full gallery social schedule. Sue will look at first 3 images on anyone’s portfolio site and will only review resumes that show art and humanities education.  Sue does not have time to browse social media and seeks potential candidates through the art and fashion community on LinkedIn.
</p>
<h3>
    Frustrations and Needs
</h3>
<p>
    Sue needs to find art for a new section of the gallery with at least 15-20 pieces of art. Sue needs an artist that is willing to start at a competitive entry-level selling-price point. Sue is also looking for someone whose art is a good cultural fit for a new Ai art magazine starting up in Paris. Since the magazine is new, it can only offer limited space to new artists. Sue is looking to hire within a very competitive artesian market. She has a limited source ofcand idates and is having a hard time finding someone with the right combination of talent, experience, and personality. She must hire within 3 weeks.
</p>
<h3>
    Goals
</h3>
<p>
    Sue has only one major issue: Is this person a potential artist for the new Ai art magazine’s high caliber status? Can Sue, within a few minutes, decide whether the artist is worthy of a preliminary phone screen regarding the limited slots available? Sue has no time to waste. Sue needs to know very quickly if the artist’s work meets the magazines qualifications to warrant a call.
</p>
<h3>
    User Story
</h3>
<p>
    As a user, I need to determine quickly whether this person is a candidate for the new Ai Art magazine.
