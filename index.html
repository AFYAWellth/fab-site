            <h1>About Us</h1>

            <p>Flowergirl & Birdie's Digital Art Space welcomes you to experience a fascinating intersection of human
                creativity & artificial intelligence.  The journey into the world of Ai Art sparks a growing fascination
                with Ai Technology, & it's ability to transform traditional art forms.  The innovative field of Ai Art
                has led us to discover a whole new realm of artistic possibilities that pull people together through the
                inspiration & creativity of talented artists from the various cultures of New Mexico.
